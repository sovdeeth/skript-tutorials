# Lists

Lists are variables that can store more than one bit of information at a time. If you haven't covered variables yet, or need a refresher, here's [the link](../../core-concepts/variables/). Also, if you haven't read [List Basics](../../core-concepts/variables/list-basics.md) yet, I highly recommend it. This page with brush over the basics, but **if you're completely new to lists, you should read the List Basics page first.**

### Basic Overview





Go back over list basics, talk about tiers/recursive lists

give examples for ways to use lists, indices of lists, how to format the list to make it easiest to use

Talk about using indices to avoid contains

Split/join
