# Global and Local

Variables, as mentioned previously, have two main "scopes" they can have. They can be global, where any script, any file, any event or function or command can access them. Or, they can be local, where only the event/function/command that created them can access them.

```applescript
on load:
    # no _ to start = global
    set {a-global-variable} to "hello, world"
    # _ at start = local
    set {_a-local-variable} to "Hey!"

    # this broadcasts "hello, world" and "Hey!"    
    broadcast {a-global-variable}
    broadcast {_a-local-variable}
    
command /test:
    trigger:
        # this broadcasts "hello, world", but not "Hey!"   
        broadcast {a-global-variable}
        broadcast {_a-local-variable}
    
```

As seen above, the global variable is the same no matter where it's accessed. The local variable, though, only is set to `"Hey!"` in the event it was defined in, the `on load`. In the command, it's not set to anything yet. This might seem annoying, but it's actually one of the strengths of local variables.

### Local Variables

Say you have an event that includes some sort of wait. Let's say, a command that draws particles for 5 seconds. If you were to use a global variable to store the location, you'd need to somehow make the name of the variable unique for every single time the command is called, otherwise the particles move somewhere else if the command is called again within the 5 seconds.

```applescript
# bad code:
command /particles:
    trigger:
        set {location} to player's location
        loop 100 times:
            show smoke at {location}
            wait 1 tick
```

However, if we use `{_location}`, a local variable, we don't have to worry about this. Each time the command is called, the location variable is only usable inside that instance of the command. This means each time the command is called, it has its own unique location stored without needing to have a unique variable name.

```applescript
# good code:
command /particles:
    trigger:
        set {_location} to player's location
        loop 100 times:
            show smoke at {_location}
            wait 1 tick
```

To reiterate: Local variables are **limited to the place they were set**. You cannot get the value of the local variable outside of when you set it, it's only accessible in the same trigger that you defined it in. If you need to pass information between triggers, or over time, use global variables.
{% endhint %}

### Global Variables

Global variables can also be extremely useful, even if they need to be unique. As shown earlier, global variables can be used as flags to pass information over time, or from one command/event to another:

```applescript
command /stop-loop:
    trigger:
        set {stop-loop} to true

# running the /stop-loop command can stop this loop, despite being a different trigger.   
on load:
    while {stop-loop} is not set:
        broadcast "ping"
        wait 1 second
```

They're also great for holding onto information over longer periods of time, like data attached to a player:

```applescript
on join:
    set {last-join::%player's uuid%} to now

on quit:
    add difference between {last-join::%player's uuid} and now to {playtime::%player%}
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Remember, global variables are **unique**. This means that if you want a variable to be different for each player, you'll have to make its name different for each player!

The easy way to do this is put the player's uuid in the variable, like so:

```applescript
set {variable::%player's uuid%} to "hello!"
```
{% endhint %}

#### Ephemeral Variables

Ephemeral variables, (or memory/RAM/temporary vars) are very easy to wrap your head around. Simply, they're just global variables with one difference. They don't get saved when the server stops. This means, of course, you don't get to save data over long-term, but you still get the benefits of the global scope. Plus, since they're not saved, they're also a lot gentler on the server.

These are extremely useful for when you need to transfer information between triggers or over time, but you don't really need to keep it around for the long term.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;Whenever you're using global variables, ask yourself if you really need to save this information over restarts. If you don't, try using an ephemeral variable.
{% endhint %}

Ephemeral variables are any variable that starts with `-`: `{-test}`, `{-my::list::of::numbers::*}`, or `{-a very long name}`. Like local variables, they aren't saved over restarts, which means they are also roughly twice as fast as using a standard global variable.

### When to Use Global vs Local

Let's summarize. Local variables are great at storing data that we only need for a short time, in a specific place. We don't have to worry about using unique names, or resetting it to some starting value, or anything like that. **Local variables should be used whenever possible.**

Global variables are great for storing data in the long term, like over server restarts. They're also great for allowing us to access data from wherever. We can set the variable in one command and access it in a completely different event, even in a different file. **Global variables should be used for long-term storage across restarts.**

Ephemeral variables are global, but aren't stored over restarts. **Use ephemeral variables for communication across various parts of a script or throughout time, where long-term saving isn't necessary.**
