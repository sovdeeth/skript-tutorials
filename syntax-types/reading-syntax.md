# Reading Syntax

In Skript, syntax such as close [the] inventory [view] (to|of|for) %players% is read as follows:

    Action Description: The syntax describes an action to close an inventory view for specified players.

    Optional Elements: Square brackets [ ] indicate optional elements. In this case, "the" and "view" are optional, so the action can be written with or without them.

    Choices: Parentheses ( ) indicate choices or alternatives. Here, it means that "to," "of," or "for" can be used interchangeably to specify the players for whom the inventory view should be closed.

    Variable: %players% represents a variable placeholder. When the script is executed, %players% will be replaced with the actual players whose inventory views are to be closed.

So, in simple terms, the syntax is saying: "Close the inventory view for the specified players."

Here are some examples of how this syntax could be used:

    close inventory to all players
    close the inventory for %player%
    close inventory view of {player}

Each of these examples would result in the specified players having their inventory views closed in the Minecraft game.
